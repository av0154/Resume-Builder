This project emphasizes on building a resume for people in an effective manner such that it can be accessible , and hassle free for the user. Building a resume is
one of the most important parts when applying for a job interview. A resume plays an important role in selection for the job interview as well. An effective resume has a lot of uses and can help the interviewer understand the potential candidate for the required job. So our web application emphasizes on getting the required information from the user to create their resume in such a way that their resumes have a clear effect on the selection process. To do so the categories we emphasize are on which place the user wishes to work and then update our application to such a manner that emphasizes it is created specially for this interview. Then we get the information of the user such as his name, educational details, previous job experiences, his extracurricular activities, his specialized skills, some recommendations from his previous employer etc.
